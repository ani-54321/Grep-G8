grep is a command-line must utility for searching plain-text data sets for lines that match a regular expression.
its name comes from the ed command g/re/p (globally search for a regular expression and print matching lines), which has the same effect.
it was originally developed for the Unix operating system, but later available for all unix-like systems and some others such as OS-9.
